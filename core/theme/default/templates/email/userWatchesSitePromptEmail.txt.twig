Hello {{ user.displayname }}

We are trying to list events on: {{ site.title }}.

{%  if futureEvents|length > 0 %}We only know of some future events.{%  else %}We don't know of any future events.{%  endif %}

If you know about any more events, can you tell everyone? You don't have to be the organiser.

It's easy to add events or recur an event that is continuing.

Do so at:
{{ config.getWebSiteDomainSecure(site.slug) }}

To stop watching {{ site.title }}:
{{ config.getWebSiteDomainSecure(site.slug) }}/stopWatchingFromEmail/{{ user.id }}/{{ stopCode }}

To change which emails you get:
{{ unsubscribeURL }}


Thanks,
{{ currentSite.title }}{% if not config.isSingleSiteMode %} {{ config.installTitle }}{%  endif %}

{% endblock %}
