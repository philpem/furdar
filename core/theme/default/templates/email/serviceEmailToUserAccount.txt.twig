Hello {{ user.displayname }}

TL;DR: OpenTechCalendar has now been transferred to Sheffield Digital. You shouldn't notice any difference. 

The change of ownership of OpenTechCalendar to Sheffield Digital is now complete. We have successfully moved the site onto new infrastructure. We'd like to thank James for all the work he put in to the preparation for the switch-over and his support during the process.

As you know, the team at Sheffield Digital are committed to developing OpenTechCalendar as an open project both in terms of making sure that the data and source code remains open, and also including the users of the site in its ongoing development. Over the coming weeks and months you will be invited to get involved in defining what features and capabilities are most useful to you as users of the tool. We hope that you’ll be part of making OTC even more useful in future.

If you want to get in touch, then please use the usual channels (https://opentechcalendar.co.uk/contact). We’d love to hear from you.

Saul Cozens

Sheffield Digital
