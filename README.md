# Open Tech Calendar fork for Furdar

This is a fork of Sheffield Digital's OpenTechCalendar, which has been customised to run the [Furdar](https://www.furdar.org) furry events calendar website.

The code was originally forked from https://gitlab.com/opentechcalendar/opentechcalendar, which at the time of forking seemed to be receiving very little love and attention.


## Documentation

See the 'docs' folder, or https://gitlab.com/opentechcalendar/opentechcalendar/tree/master/docs.

OpenTechCalendar was previously known as [OpenACalendar](https://github.com/OpenACalendar), and some other documentation is available in the following locations:

  * [Superuser documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/openacalendar-superusers/downloads/pdf/latest/) -- covers installation, superuser backend management, APIs and extensions.

These are less useful:

  * [Administrator documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/openacalendar-administrators/downloads/pdf/latest/) -- really only covers user permissions
  * [User documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/openacalendar-users/downloads/pdf/latest) -- largely a stub
